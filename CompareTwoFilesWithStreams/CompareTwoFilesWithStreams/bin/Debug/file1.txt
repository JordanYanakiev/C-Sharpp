Once upon a time there was a brave rabbit.
The brave rabbit was 
ready to go anywhere and to do 
anything just for the sake 
of doing the thing. 
One morning he woke up
and had a thought: 
"I want to do the things 
that i usually do, 
but instead for the sake of just doig the 
things I would like 
to get paid fo them."
